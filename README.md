# Mind-of-Health
The way back to a healthy mind after trauma. I as well as many others have had some sort of trauma in our lives no matter what it may be.
We are all by far from perfect , but we are who we are. Overcoming Mental Health issues doesn't just happen overnight, nor does it go away after a few years as some say.
Usually being diagnosed with a mental illness is a life long problem. Most of the time or at least 75% people may have to be on medication the rest of their lives.
Others it may not effect so bad. The stigma surrounding Mental Illness has become such a problem here in the United States as well as other countries who don't have the resources we have,
And don't know how to be properly diagnosed. When something happens pertaining to whether a person has a panic attack when they see someone/something that brings back a traumatic event 
 or an argument in a relationship the biggest excuse if the person has a disablitly/Mental illness
That is what gets blamed on the person. Whether is the person saying "Just get over it already " or "It's all in your head", But you know what??
If more people would do the research on mental health disorders when they know someone with one
And take the time to listen when we,I,you try to explain it's like getting shutdown or kicked when already down.
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW ITS OK NOT TO BE OK.....There are resources available and people to talk to
And it is nothing to be ashamed of.

As far as for this purpose I DO NOT want to have any post from people making fun, NO DEROGATORY COMMENTS, NO RACIAL SLURS, NO POLITICAL ISSUES
And please know by all means anything within here mentioned is not pertaining to an specific person in any way,shape,or form. 
If you decide to take it that way then your possibly one of the problems
with the stigma.
